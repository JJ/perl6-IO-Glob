v0.3    December 11, 2016

    * Fix #4: The API of IO::Path changed, breaking tests. Better
      checks to make sure we stringify the filename prior to using it in both
      places.
    * PR #5: Updated a spot in the docs making a similar fix to make sure to
      stringify explicitly to get the filename back. (HT: @JJ)
     
v0.2    August 30, 2016

    * Fix: Some patterns did not work. Collecting char-match terms together
      fixes the problem.
    * Fix: Sort directory results when testing because .dir order is not
      guaranteed. (HT: ppentchev)

v0.1    February 10, 2016

    * Initial release.
